# homework5

In for this homework, the goal was to make a planner type app that lists the current time/day and gives 9-5 work hours for the user to
add text information and have access to a 'save' button.
The user should be able to add information that will be stored in local data when the save button is pushed, so that when the page is 
refreshed the information will remain.
Furthermore, the text box rows will change colors depending on if the current time is earlier or later than the time for the text row.
If the time is later than a text row's time, it will have a grey background, red for current text box, and green for those that are still
to come.
